## Astro Sounding 

**Abstract**

This project investigates the application of sonification techniques to galactic imagery, transforming visual data into an auditory modality. Leveraging Python libraries, including OpenCV and NumPy, the project performs a detailed analysis of image pixel data (RGB values) to establish a quantifiable mapping between visual attributes (color and brightness) and corresponding auditory parameters. This methodology offers a novel approach to the analysis and interpretation of astronomical data.

**Project Functionalities**

The project encompasses the following core functionalities:

*   **Data Acquisition:** Imports galactic image data from a specified data source.
*   **Colorimetric Analysis:** Executes a comprehensive analysis of the color composition of each image within the dataset.
*   **Visual Rendering:** Generates visual representations of the galaxy images for detailed inspection and verification.
*   **Data Persistence:** Stores extracted color information in a persistent format for subsequent processing and analysis workflows.
*   **Visual Data Representation:** Produces visual representations of the extracted color data to facilitate enhanced interpretation and pattern recognition.

**Project Structure**

*   `data/`: Directory containing the galactic image dataset.
*   `.ipynb` Notebooks: Executable computational notebooks containing the implemented code for image processing and sonification procedures.
*   `output/`: Directory for the storage of extracted color data and generated visual outputs.
